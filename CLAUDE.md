### üö® CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE üö®
**NEVER COMMIT FIREBASE SERVICE ACCOUNT KEYS OR ANY CREDENTIALS TO GIT**
- All Firebase service account keys must be stored as environment variables
- Run `./scripts/pre-commit-check.sh` before EVERY commit to check for secrets
- Service account JSON files should NEVER exist in the repository
- Use environment variables: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` (JSON string)
- If you need service account files locally, name them: `firebase-admin-key.json` (already in .gitignore)

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your_project_id-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Firebase Admin SDK (for production)
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY='{"type":"service_account","project_id":"your_project_id",...}'

# Legacy (for migration scripts)
SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=64_character_hex_key_for_aes_256_encryption
```

### Firebase Admin SDK Setup
- **Local Development**: Place `firebase-admin-key.json` in project root (already gitignored)
- **Production**: Set `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` environment variable with full service account JSON as string

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.2.4 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Database**: Firebase Realtime Database + Firestore (dual-database architecture)
- **Real-time**: Firebase Realtime Database for messaging and presence
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication with email/password + email verification
- **Security**: Firebase Security Rules, input validation, rate limiting

### Directory Structure
- `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and API routes
  - `api/` - Server endpoints for Firebase operations and legacy API compatibility
  - `auth/verify/` - Email verification page
  - Client components use `"use client"` directive
- `components/` - React components including shadcn/ui components
  - `ui/` - shadcn/ui components
  - `auth-landing.tsx`, `sign-in.tsx`, `sign-up.tsx` - Authentication components
  - `chat-interface.tsx`, `profile-step1.tsx`, `profile-step2.tsx` - Main app components
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks for Firebase chat and authentication
- `lib/` - Utility functions and core business logic
  - `firebase.ts`, `firebase-auth-client.ts`, `firebase-database.ts` - Firebase integration
  - `zipcode-utils.ts`, `validation.ts` - Utility functions
- `scripts/` - Database initialization and testing utilities
- `middleware.ts` - Security headers and request handling

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Real-time Communication**: Firebase Realtime Database handles all real-time messaging and presence updates through optimized listeners and subscriptions (`use-firebase-chat.ts`).

2. **Email Authentication Flow**: Complete email/password authentication with verification:
   - Separate Sign In/Sign Up components with validation
   - Email verification required before account access
   - Post-verification auto-signin with direct onboarding redirect
   - Session persistence with localStorage and Firebase Auth

3. **Dual Database Architecture**: 
   - **Firestore**: User profiles, sessions, favorites, structured data
   - **Realtime Database**: Messages, presence, active chats, real-time updates

4. **Database Operations**: Firebase integration through structured modules:
   - `lib/firebase-database.ts` - Dual database operations with legacy compatibility
   - `lib/firebase-auth-client.ts` - Authentication and session management
   - `lib/firebase.ts` - Core Firebase configuration and initialization

5. **Security Architecture**: 
   - Firebase Security Rules for both databases
   - Input validation (`lib/validation.ts`)  
   - Rate limiting (`lib/rate-limiter.ts`)
   - Email verification enforcement
   - CORS and security headers via middleware

6. **Profile Management**: 
   - 2-step onboarding (profile creation + location detection)
   - Immutable profiles once locked (monetization ready)
   - Automatic location detection with manual fallback
